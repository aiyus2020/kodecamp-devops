# 🛠️ Introduction to DevOps and Lifecycle Stages

## 🚀 What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a cultural and technical approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between **development** and **operations** teams. It aims to shorten the software development lifecycle, deliver features faster, and improve quality and reliability through automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

### 🌐 Core Principles of DevOps:
- **Collaboration:** Bridging gaps between dev and ops teams.
- **Automation:** Streamlining repetitive tasks such as testing and deployment.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Iterative development, delivery, and feedback.
- **Customer-Centric Action:** Rapid response to user needs and feedback.

## 🔄 DevOps Lifecycle Stages

### 📌 Planning  
Define project requirements, timelines, and collaboration goals. Teams align on business objectives.

### 💻 Development  
Code is written, reviewed, and managed using version control tools like Git.

### 🧱 Building  
Source code is compiled and built into executable artifacts using build automation tools.

### 🧪 Testing  
Automated and manual tests are conducted to ensure code quality, functionality, and security.

### 🚀 Release  
Validated code is approved and prepared for deployment into production environments.

### 📦 Deployment  
Code is deployed to production systems using automated pipelines, ensuring speed and consistency.

### ⚙️ Operations  
Live systems are managed and maintained to ensure availability, scalability, and performance.

### 📊 Monitoring  
System health, performance metrics, and user behavior are tracked to identify and resolve issues proactively.
