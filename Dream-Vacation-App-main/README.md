# Dream Vacation App – Dockerized 🌍🐳

This project focuses on the **containerization of a full-stack application** using Docker and Docker Compose. The app is made up of:

- A React frontend  
- A Node.js backend  
- A PostgreSQL database

---

## 🛠️ What Was Done

- The **frontend and backend code** was already provided. here [code](https://github.com/obusorezekiel/Dream-Vacation-App)
- I wrote the `Dockerfile` for both the **frontend** and **backend**.
- I created the `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate all services.
- I created a `.env` file for managing environment variables.
- A `.gitignore` file was added to prevent the `.env` file from being pushed, as it contains sensitive data like database credentials.
- Create a repository for each service:
    *dream-vacation-frontend*
    *dream-vacation-backend*

- I built and pushed the **Docker images** to **Docker Hub**.

```bash
docker build -t aiyus/dream-vacation-frontend ./frontend
docker build -t aiyus/dream-vacation-backend ./backend
docker aiyus/dream-vacation-frontend
docker aiyus/dream-vacation-backend

```
- I started the containers using:

```bash
docker-compose up  -d
```
