### ðŸ§¾ Brief Explanation of the Script

The `todo.sh` script is a **Bash-based terminal application** that allows users to manage a simple to-do list. Here's what it does:

1. **Creates a file** named `todo.txt` in the user's home directory if it doesn't already exist.
2. **Displays a menu** with four options:

   * View all tasks
   * Add a new task
   * Delete a task
   * Exit the program
3. Based on the userâ€™s input:

   * Option 1 displays the list of tasks using `nl` to number each task.
   * Option 2 prompts the user to enter a new task and appends it to `todo.txt`.
   * Option 3 shows the numbered task list, then lets the user delete a task by its number using `sed`.
   * Option 4 exits the script using `exit 0`.

The script uses basic commands like `read`, `echo`, `nl`, `sed`, and a `while` loop to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit.
